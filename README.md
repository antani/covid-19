# covid-19
This is a fork of the original and outstanding [work done](https://github.com/k-sys/covid-19) by 
[Kevin Systrom](https://github.com/k-sys) to estimate the daily changes in R_t state-wise in the 
United States. This is simply an adaptation of that work to estimate R_t state-wise in India.
